## pwm_sweep.ino
- by digital output pin 11, generate pwm command using "analogWrite" function.

- Circuit schematics 


## pwm_read_write.ino
- read variable resistance from analog input A01,
- set saturation limit between 0 to 255
- set rate limit between +- 2/step
- write pwm signal on digital pin 11
- circuit schematics


## sketch_rgb.ino
- pwm pin 5, 6, 9 for R, G, B
- changing for R, G, B automatically
- R,G,B in char
-
